# Taxi Data Handling

Filtering and displaying data related to numerous taxi rides.

## Getting Started

To see data filtering and display in action, download files: DataBundle,DataFilter,DataTableLayout.
Also highly recommend downloading taxi rides data as well, or use a same formatted file as input data (unrecommended - high probability of program malfunctioning while parsing the data).

### Prerequisites

As stated previously, the most important thing is the input data, so make sure you use the file compatible with the program.
Other than that you will need :

```
Standard Java libraries.
```

### Installing

For use within IDE

```
Copy / download the files and run the Main within the DataTableLayout class
```

For use as an application

```
Open the file in IDE, simply export it as a "Runnable JAR file".
```

## Deployment

```
Get the application running.
```
```
Locate the file on your computer using the built-in File Locator.
```
```
Define filters you want to see displayed, by clicking on the "Define Filter" menu.
```
```
Apply the filter(s) by clicking on the "Apply Filter" button.
```

Additional note: the filters can not be removed once you had applied them. To remove filters, you will have to load up the file once again.
